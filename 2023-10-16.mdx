## What’s new?

Discover the latest enhancements and feature updates at Xata:

- **Added support for top values aggregations** - This update introduces support for top values aggregations on fields with data types of `int`, `float`, and `bool`. Previously, only fields with the data type `string` were supported for this aggregation method. This enhancement expands the applicable field types to include `Keyword`, `Numeric`, `ip`, `boolean`, or `binary`.
- **Improved SQL autocompletion feature** - We’ve introduced advanced SQL context parsing and made significant improvements to autocompletion for SQL keywords, table names, and column names. This provides a more refined SQL query development experience, allowing users to work with complex queries.
- **URL retrieval for file transformations** - Introducing a new Python helper function contributed by the community. This function focuses on optimizing the retrieval of URLs for file transformations. (xata-py 178) (https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/pull/178).
