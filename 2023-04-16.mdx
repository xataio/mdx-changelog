#### API

- Improved error message on for null columns without a default value. This is a common source of confusion and, yes, weâ€™re working on fixing better by allowing not null columns without defaults.

#### UI

- Better confirmation messages when deleting columns or tables. The names of the affected column and table are now included in the confirmation, for example:
    
<ArticleImage
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/mdx-changelog/main/images/table-delete.png"
  width="826"
  height="522"
  alt="Table delete confirmation"
  caption="Table delete confirmation"
  position="center"
/>
- When canceling an editing operation, we now only show a confirmation dialog if there were any changes.
- The column ordering is now used consistently every where we use it: in the edit drawer, in filters/sorting dialogs, in the schema page, etc.
- Fixed the generated code in the Get Code Snippet that was sometimes producing dates with an invalid format.
- Also fixed an issue where the `'` character in filters was producing an error in the Get Code Snippet.
- Fixed an issue with editing the ID when adding a new record.
- Fixed scrolling behaviour when renaming or deleting Link columns in the Schema view.
- Sidebar links are now proper `<a>` elements so you can right-click and open in a new tab.
