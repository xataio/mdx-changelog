- Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` meta-columns. From now on, you always know when
  something was created and last updated. You get them with the record metadata,
  as simple as that. This was a common feature request that makes developers
  life easier, which is our favorite type of feature to
  implement: [https://feedback.xata.io/feature-requests/p/implement-createdat-updatedat-fields](https://feedback.xata.io/feature-requests/p/implement-createdat-updatedat-fields).
  It is now also possible to filter by these meta-columns.
- Database renames! It sounds simple, but while it was possible to rename almost
  anything in Xata, database names were forever. Now you can finally fix that typo
  from the first day of your project. Be aware that this impacts the URLs under 
  which the database is available, so it will be a breaking change to your application.
- Transactions: add `failMissing` option for deletes. If you set this flag to true, 
  and the delete operations affects zero records, the transaction will be failed.
- Fix occasional 500 error in the Ask endpoint that happened on particular inputs
- When returning errors about multiple columns, have the columns sorted by name.
- Added a `factor` option to the free-text-search date booster. The `factor`
  multiplies the boost, allowing you to better control the effect of the date booster.
- Better error message on `unique` + `notNull` columns.
- In the UI, moved database menu functionality to database settings page.
- Bigger scroll target when dragging-and-dropping a column. Makes it easier to move
  columns around in the table view, especially when having lots of columns.
- For the Vercel integration, redirect to the main page if the user is signed-in
  already. Fixed a couple more issues around the Vercel integration.
- Handle filter, sort and hidden columns when a column is deleted. This fixes some
  corner error conditions after a column was deleted.
