## What’s new?

Discover the latest enhancements and feature updates at Xata:

- **Release of Go SDK**: We've released our official [Go SDK](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go), adding to our existing [Python](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts) offerings. This new Go SDK provides improved performance and better concurrency support, ideal for Go developers. For more information, refer to our [docs](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/go/overview). 
- **Improved UI in schema editor**: Implemented title truncation in the schema editor to prevent table overflow, enhancing the overall user interface and readability.
- **Workspace deletion update**: You can now delete workspaces even if they have active subscriptions, providing enhanced control over workspace management. Additionally, the confirmation modal has been updated to inform you about any active subscriptions associated with a workspace before its deletion.

Build an app on top of Xata, and submit your project by January 15, 2024, for an opportunity to win prizes.
