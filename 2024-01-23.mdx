### What's new

- File uploads from the browser! This was a highly requested feature for file attachments. The way it works is that you can create a new record without passing the file, you get back an `uploadUrl` that is safe to pass to the browser, then you upload the file to that URL. For more details, see the documentation for [Upload URLs](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/file-attachments#upload-urls). This [example](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/sample-nextjs-upload-file) demonstrate doing files uploads directly from the browser, in a sample Next.js application.
- We've shipped a new onboarding workflow for creating and connecting to databases. The new workflow asks a few questions and then displays instructions that fit with your particular case.

- Cloudflare launched a database integration for Xata. Please see the docs [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/xata/), and there's also a demo on Cloudflare TV.
- Lots of tables? You're going to enjoy this quality of life improvement where you get a search box on top of the list of tables.
