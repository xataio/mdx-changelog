### What's new

- We continued to improve the Postgres wire compatibility with more clients and ORMs:
    - Improved the extended wire protocol by supporting flows not starting with a `Sync` message. 
    - Added support for the `DEALLOCATE` statement.
    - Added support for `current_user`, `current_role`, `session_user`, and `user` functions.
    - Added support for `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions.
    - Correctly handle `CommandComplete` and `EmptyQueryResponse` messages in the Postgres wire protocol. This fixes a bug where the client would hang in particular situations.
    - Added support for `information_schema._pg_expandarray` over the Postgres wire protocol.
    - Clarified error message on failed internal authentication.
- We also continued to improve Dedicated Clusters, currently in private alpha: 
    - It's now possible to enable extensions (`CREATE EXTENSION`).
    - Termination is now self-service.
    - Email notifications for cluster events.
- The admin UI also got a nice set of improvements:
    - Add support default, unique, and not null constraints on all column types in the UI schema editor.
    - Nicer "branch not found" error page.
    - Copy button in the Edit record dialog for the disabled fields. 
    - Fixed last calendar month view in the Usage page. 
    - Fixed email column type validation to match the backend.
    - Fixed bug when editing columns of type "multiple".
    - Fixed error when filtering by a File column being NULL.
    - Fixed scrolling issues on workspace pages.
- The `xata schema edit` CLI command now works with Postgres wire protocol enabled branches.

### What's new in pgroll

- [#341](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/341) Allow rename-only `alter column` operations on unbackfillable columns. Rename operations don't require backfills so there is no reason to impose such a restriction.
- [#344](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/344) Add a `set comment` sub-operation to `alter column`. The intention is that this can be combined with a `change type` sub-operation if there is some column metadata that should be updated as part of the type change.
- [#345](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/345) Support setting table and column comments to NULL. Without this change it was impossible to remove a comment from a column using the `set comment` sub-operation
- [#346](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/346) Add a `set default` sub-operation to `alter column`.
