We have launched the all new [Xata Workflow](https://xata.io/blog/workflow-github-vercel-netlify-xata): complete git-like workflow for your database. This includes:

- GitHub app that follows your PRs and creates Xata branches for you,
- Vercel integration, making it much easier to connect your Xata DB with your Vercel project,
- Netlify integration and plugin, connecting your Xata DB with your Netlify proejct
- data copying between branches,
- Storing of migration in the repo and CLI pull and push command for schema changes,
- automatic migrations when you merge the Pull Request.

Other fixes and improvements:

- Improved error messages when parsing invalid JSON. Because we obsess over good error messages.
- Fixed renaming of columns and tables when only casing is changed.
- When accepting workspace invitations, treat email addresses case insensitive. This makes it easier to invite your colleagues.
- Fixed border on table cells, making keyboard navigation in the table much easier.
- Fixed the record count after generating random data from the UI.
- Fixed working with hidden linked columns in the UI.
