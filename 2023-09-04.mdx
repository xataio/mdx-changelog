### What's new?

Discover the latest enhancements and feature updates at Xata:

- **A new look for Xata.io** - We've given [Xata.io](https://xata.io) a fresh new look, making it even more user-friendly. This redesign includes several improvements, such as clearer messaging and a streamlined workflow, all aimed at providing an improved experience for our users.
- **File Attachments are now available** - We have embedded [file attachments](https://xata.io/file-attachments) directly into our serverless database and improved the experience for building data apps that require binary storage.
- **New UI experience for CSV import and export** - Introducing an entirely new [CSV import and export](https://xata.io/docs/csv-data/import-data) interface that simplifies your Xata.io experience, enabling you to automatically create new tables by directly importing your data into Xata's database. The export feature allows you to download your data as CSV files.

- **Support for JSON ingestion** - Basic support for [JSON column](https://xata.io/blog/json-column-type) types is now available, expanding the range of data formats that Xata.io can handle. 
- **Improved data traversal with reverse links**  - We now provide [column expressions](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/data-model#links-and-relationships) in the query endpoint for more precise projection definitions with JSON objects. The new Xata querying syntax makes it possible to [traverse the N:1 relationships backwards and solves the N + 1 problem](https://xata.io/blog/navigating-many-to-one). 
- **The Xata Python SDK is in GA** - Our [Python SDK](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/python/overview) is now in general availability. We're excited to release version 1.0.0 of our Python SDK, offering a more stable and feature-rich experience for developers.
- **Direct SQL access** - We've introduced support for [SQL](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/sql/overview) (Postgres dialect) over HTTP, with a focus on safety. 
  - To ensure secure SQL access to Xata databases, we've developed a dedicated SQL proxy. The proxy works alongside the Xata data API, enhancing security between Postgres, routing, and authentication components. 
  - We have plans to further expand SQL support and introduce the Postgres Wire protocol for maximum compatibility. 
- **New integrations** - Xata now offers integrations with [LangChain](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/langchain), the ORM [Drizzle](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/drizzle), and the TypeScript builder [Kysley](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/kysley), expanding the range of tools and possibilities for developers.
- **Xata's new framework guides** - Our getting started guides for the frameworks [Astro](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/astro), [Next.js](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/nextjs), [Nuxt](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/nuxt), [Remix](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/remix), [SolidStart](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/solidstart), and [SvelteKit](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/sveltekit) have undergone a significant overhaul. These getting started guides provide a more user-friendly introduction to Xata. Explore the guides to learn how to use the Xata CLI, create databases, define schemas, import CSV data, and make the most of querying, filtering, and full-text fuzzy search capabilities.
