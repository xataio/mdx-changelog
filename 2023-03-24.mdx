### API

- Sometimes all you need is a bit of randomness. A new sort option allows you to “sort by random”. This can be useful, for example, to show a random sample of results from the table. To use, see the [examples in the docs.](https://xata.io/docs/typescript-client/get#sorting-the-results) The options looks like this in the API:

```sql
{
  "sort": ["*:random"]
}
```

And like this in the TypeScript SDK (pending release):

```sql
const users = await xata.db.Users
  .sort("*", "random")
  .getMany();
```

- Fix: in some cases the context passed to ChatGPT was smaller than our target number of tokens, resulting in low quality answers. This is now fixed.
- Fix: drastically reduce the chance of `too_many_nested_clauses` ****exception on the search and ask endpoints. Also improved the error message to guide towards a correct solution.

### UI

- Added the ability to filter on vector columns being NULL.
- Added the ability to paste an datetime into a datetime cell in the grid. e.g. `26/05/18` or `tomorrow at 4pm`
- Fixes for the behavior of the Chat bot when them Ask button is pressed multiple times or the tabs are changed.
- Fixed the display of empty strings as a default value in the Schema view.

### CLI

- Added support for the vector column to the `xata schema edit` command.
