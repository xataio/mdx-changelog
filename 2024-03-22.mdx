- Day 2: pgroll is now integrated into Xata, opening the door for painless, zero-downtime, reversible schema migrations
- Day 3: Usage monitoring. Get analytics for your database. Also updates to our Prisma and Drizzle integrations.
- Day 4: pgzx, open source project for building Postgres extensions with Zig.
- Day 5: Dedicated clusters, currently in private alpha, they offer better isolation, security, and cost efficiency at scale.
- Day 6: Xata website refresh. We've updated our website to reflect the new features and offerings.
