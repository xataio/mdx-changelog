### Launch week: Elephant on the move 🚀🐘

Last week we had our [Elephant on the move](https://xata.io/launch-week-elephant-on-the-move) Launch Week. Here is what we announced each day:

- Day 1: Dedicated Clusters are entering public Beta. This means all of you can start a Dedicate Cluster and also take advantage of the $1000 in free credits!
- Day 2: Multi-version schema updates are now available in the Xata platform. We're now bringing magic of pgroll zero-downtime, reversible schema migrations to the Xata cloud service.
- Day 3: Introducing pgstream. pgstream is a CDC tool focused on PostgreSQL. It supports notifying on schema changes in addition to just data changes.
- Day 4: Major version upgrade without the downtime. You can now do Postgres major version upgrades by using Xata dedicated clusters and a few clicks in the UI.
- Day 5: New pgroll and pgzx versions released.
