## What’s new?

Discover the latest enhancements and feature updates at Xata:

- **Added blog navigation by tags:** We've introduced a new feature that simplifies blog exploration. Now, you can easily discover blog posts by appending tags such as "postgres," "engineering," "product," "community," and more to the end of the blog tags URL (`https://xata.io/blog/tags`). This enables you to find and browse blog posts relevant to your specific areas of interest. For example, you can access all Xata blog posts related to PostgreSQL using the following URL: `https://xata.io/blog/tags/postgres`, or filter by two tags using a URL like this: `https://xata.io/blog/tags/community,announcements`. In addition, tags will soon be accessible directly through the UI for even easier navigation.
- **Enhanced CSV file import support:** This update introduces the capability to import both remote and local files from a CSV. Only the file's path, URL, or base64 encoding is required. While this feature is currently available in the CLI, we plan to support it in the Xata app soon.
- **Enhanced search responses:** Closing a [common feature request](https://xata.canny.io/feature-requests/p/include-total-hits-in-search-response), the TypeScript SDK `v0.27.0` introduces the `totalCount` field in search responses (including `search`, `search.byTable`, `search.all`, and `vectorSearch`) to report the total number of matching records. This is considered a minor breaking change as the response format is now an object, not an array. Adding the total hits to every search response makes it easier for the client to decide whether to fetch another page of results. [ts-client#1232](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts/pull/1232)
- **Improved Python syntax and error messages:** The playground now offers better syntax highlighting and a more intuitive display of errors for Python code.
- **Migration to monorepo:** Our website, application, and documentation have successfully migrated to a monorepo structure. This means that related Xata projects, components, and resources are now stored in a single repository for improved code management and collaboration. This update lays the foundation for a more personalized and immersive user experience across the different entities.
- **Python code snippets and improved connector information:** We’ve added Python code snippets within the playground. Users can now easily integrate and experiment with Python for an improved development experience. Additionally, we've enhanced the connector info for Drizzle and Kysely snippets across local repositories, covering all data types for a better user experience.

- **Support for importing vector columns:** With this enhancement, you can now import vector columns through the in-app CSV import wizard.

### Latest developments in pgroll

Take a look at the recent progress in our [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) project:

- **[_NEW_]** **Security definer added:** With the addition of the `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute, the security model of the pgroll schema allows admins to restrict access while ensuring uninterrupted functionality [pgroll#191](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/191). Thank you @jankatins for your contribution.
- **[_FIX_]** **Fixed `previous_version` function:** Resolved an issue where the `previous_version` function did not correctly remove the previous version schema upon completing migrations applied in schemas other than public and enhanced testing to ensure that the `--schema flag` is properly respected [pgroll#190](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/190)
