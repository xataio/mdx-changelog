#### API

- Do more with less round-trips. Our Transaction API endpoint can now not only `insert`, `update` and `delete,` but also `get` data by ID. An example looks like this:

```tsx
{
  "operations": [
    {"insert": {"table": "items", "record": {"id": "new-0", "name": "feed the fish"}, "createOnly": true}},
    {"update": {"table": "items", "id": "new-0", "fields": {"name": "feed the goldfish"}, "ifVersion": 0}},
    {"get": {"table": "items", "id": "new-0", "columns": ["id","name"]}},
    {"delete": {"table": "items", "id": "new-0"}}
  ]
}
```

#### UI

- The ‚ÄúGet Code snippet‚Äù dialog is now a lot more helpful to Windows users as we‚Äôve added support for `PowerShell` and `cmd` üéâ

- Continuing our theme of quality of life improvements:
  - Allow copy pasting of null cell values, because ‚Äúnulls‚Äù are important to developers.
  - Improvements in the filtering inputs.
  - Fixed a bug where editing emails and numbers was sometimes moving the cursor at the end
