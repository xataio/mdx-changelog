### What's new with Xata

**UI improvements**

You might have noticed already, but we've been beautifying the UI in the past weeks. For example, check out this empty state page for a new database: ðŸ¤©

Other UI improvements:

* The Playground now supports running multiple statements at once.
* The branch selector got an upgrade and now works better with looooong branch names.
* Fixed using `now()` as a default value for date columns.


**Postgres compatibility improvements**

Also the past couple of weeks we've seen a ton of improvements to our compatibility with the Postgres wire protocol:
  * Improved compatibility with more tools that use the Postgres wire protocol, including JetBrains DataGrip.
  * Added support for several system info functions.
  * Allow locking clauses in SELECT statements. For example, the following is now supported: `SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE name = 'John' FOR UPDATE`.
  * Improved compatibility and fixed issues when running [Ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio) with Xata.
  * Reduced clutter and errors during pg_restore runs.
  * Added support for `SHOW session_replication_role`.

**Extensions!**

We added support for the first extensions on shared clusters:

* Added support for [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector). You can now use either pgvector or the Xata vector implementation based on Lucene.
* Added support for the [uuid-ossp](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html) extension. You can use its functions to generate different UUID flavours.

**Dedicated clusters**

We've worked on improving the stability and usability of dedicated clusters, currently in private alpha, but quickly moving towards public beta:

* Better validation for cluster names to prevent a common source of errors.
* Added support for terminating clusters.
* Added support limited support for DO blocks. More improvements coming soon.

**Data API**

Also our API, more specifically the SQL over HTTP part, got an important update:

* Support batching multiple SQL commands in a single request over the HTTP API.
