- **Improved error handling**: We’ve introduced advanced SQL context parsing and made significant improvements to autocompletion for SQL keywords, table names, and column names. This provides a more refined SQL query development experience, allowing users to work with complex queries.
- **JSON `bigint` parsing issued fixed**: Addressed and resolved parsing errors encountered with invalid bigints in JSON handling.
- **Fix for CLI installation issue**: Corrected a module loading error encountered during the installation of the Xata CLI. The error was related to the inability to find the `tslib` package, which occurred with version 0.14.3 on Node v20.9.0. The issue is now fixed. [PR #1245](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts/pull/1245)

### Latest developments in pgroll

Take a look at the recent progress in our [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) project:

- **[NEW]** **Added set replica identity operation type**: Introduced a new operation type for setting replica identity. This feature allows setting the replica identity of tables, like fruits, to FULL, index, default, or nothing. For index type, specify the index name. The replica identity applies to both new and old versions of the table upon operation start. [PR #201](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/201) To ensure new tables in pgroll-enabled branches have `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, a second migration now automatically runs right after the `create table` migration. This is necessary because Postgres doesn't allow setting the replica identity during table creation.
- **[NEW]** **Brew update**: As pgroll has been updated to version v0.4.0, Homebrew users can now get the latest features and improvements for Postgres zero-downtime migrations. To get the latest version, run **`brew install pgroll`** or update an existing installation with `brew upgrade pgroll`.
- **[FIX]** **Fixed primary key function**: The revised SQL query enhances performance in cluster environments with a large number of schema objects. This change leads to faster and more efficient data retrieval in complex databases. [PR #198](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/198)
- **[FIX]** **Connection establishment enhancement**: Improved the error messaging for database connections by introducing a ping to the database right after connection establishment. This update ensures error messages are more straightforward and specific to the connection issue, eliminating the previously seen unrelated prefixes in error descriptions. [PR #195](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/195)
- **[FIX]** **Default value update for column additions**: Default value auto-quoting for new columns has been removed to fix issues with time-based defaults like `now()`. Users need to manually quote necessary default values going forward. [PR #200](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/pull/200)
